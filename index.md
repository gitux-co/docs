## Why Developers Switch to Gitux

GitUX was born out of frustration. Git clients either lacked a beautiful UI, were bloated with features nobody asked for, or charged a yearly subscription. We built something different.

<div class="features-grid">

### No More Subscriptions
**£24 once. Yours forever.** Other Git clients charge £50–100/year. Gitux costs less than one year — and it's yours for life.

### Lightweight & Fast
Launches instantly, stays responsive. Even with large repos. No bloat, no waiting.

### Privacy First
Voice recognition runs locally. Your code never leaves your machine. No telemetry, no cloud.

### Keyboard-Driven
Every action has a shortcut. Stage, commit, push, and navigate without touching the mouse.
