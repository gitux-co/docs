## Why Gitux?

GitUX was born out of frustration with the state of Git clients. They either lacked a beautiful UI or were bloated with features we didn't need, or charged a yearly subscription fee. GitUX is simple, fast, and focused on what you need to get done.

For developers who want Git's power without the command line complexity or bloated tools.

<div class="features-grid">

### Lightweight & Fast
Launches fast, stays responsive. Even with large repos.

### No More Subscriptions
**£24 once. That's it.** The world is tired of subscriptions. Buy software, own it forever, just like we used to in the 90s and 2000s. While other Git clients charge £50-100/year forever, Gitux costs less than one year of the alternatives and it's yours for life.

### Privacy First
Voice recognition runs on your machine. Your code never leaves your computer.

### Keyboard-Driven
Every action has a shortcut. `Alt+O` to switch repos, `Ctrl+S` to stage all, `Alt+1-4` for commit prefixes.

</div>

## Perfect For

- **Solo developers** wanting a visual overview of their work
- **Teams** reviewing branch histories
- **Open source contributors** juggling multiple repos
- **Anyone** tired of typing `git log --oneline --graph --all`

Easily keep an eye on which git commands are being run every step of the way:
