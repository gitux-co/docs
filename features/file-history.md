## Tips

### Check the Right File
Ensure you're viewing history for the correct path. Renamed files may have separate histories.

### Read Commit Messages
Good messages explain why changes were made.

### Check Related Files
If history doesn't explain everything, check files changed in the same commits.

## Limitations

### Renamed Files
History may not follow renames automatically. You might see history only from the rename forward.

### Deleted Files
Cannot open history for deleted files from UI. Use terminal:
```bash
git log --all -- path/to/deleted/file
```

### Large Histories
Files with many commits may take a moment to load.
