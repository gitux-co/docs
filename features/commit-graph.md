# Visual Commit Graph

The commit graph is Gitux's centerpiece — a visual representation of your entire Git history.

![Visual Commit Graph](/screenshots/Screenshot%20-%20rich%20commit%20graph.png)

## What You See

The commit graph displays:
- **Commit dots** — Each commit as a point on the graph
- **Branch lines** — Colored paths connecting related commits
- **Branch labels** — Names showing where branches point
- **Merge points** — Where branches come together
- **HEAD indicator** — Your current position

## Graph Layout

```
┌────────┬─────────────────────────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│ Graph  │ Commit Message          │ Author   │ Date/Time   │
├────────┼─────────────────────────┼──────────┼─────────────┤
│   ●    │ feat: add user auth     │ John     │ 2 hours ago │
│   │    │                         │          │             │
│   ●    │ fix: resolve timeout    │ Jane     │ 5 hours ago │

## Color Coding

Each branch gets a distinct color:
- Lines of the same color belong to the same branch
- Merge commits show multiple colors converging
- The current branch is highlighted

## Interacting with Commits

### Single Click
Click a commit to:
- Open the commit details panel
- See all files changed in that commit
- View diffs for any file

### Scroll for More
The graph loads commits incrementally:
- Initial load shows recent commits
- Scroll down to load older history
- "End of commit history" appears at the bottom

### Uncommitted Changes
If you have uncommitted changes, they appear at the top:
- Shows count of staged and unstaged files
- Visually distinct from actual commits

## Commit Details

When you click a commit, you see:

### File List
- All files modified in the commit
- Status badges (M, A, D, R, C)
- Addition/deletion counts
- Toggle between list and folder view

### Diff Viewer
- Click any file to see its changes
- Unified or split view
- Syntax highlighting
- Minimap navigation

## Context Menu

Right-click a commit for options:
- Reset branch to this commit
- Copy commit hash
- View full details

## Performance

Gitux handles large repositories efficiently:
- **Lazy loading** — Only loads visible commits
- **Virtual scrolling** — Smooth scrolling through thousands of commits
- **Incremental updates** — Refreshes only what changed

## Branch Visualization

### Linear History
Simple projects show a straight line of commits.

### Feature Branches
Branches appear as lines diverging and merging back.

### Complex Histories
Even complicated merge patterns are rendered clearly with distinct colors.

## Search & Filter

A powerful [Search & Filter](/features/search-filter) bar sits above the graph:

- **`Ctrl+F`** to toggle the search panel
- **Search** commit messages and hashes
- **Filter by author** to see one person's work
- **Date range** to narrow to a time window
- **File search** to find any file and jump to its history
- **File browser** to explore the repo tree visually

When filters are active, the graph shows only matching commits with a count: "Showing 12 of 847 commits".

## Tips

### Find a Commit
Use the search bar (`Ctrl+F`) to search by message or hash. Or click a branch in the sidebar to scroll to its latest commit.

### Understand Merges
Follow the colored lines to see which branches were merged and when.

### Track Authors
The author column helps identify who made each change.
