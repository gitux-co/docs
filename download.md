# Download Gitux

Choose your platform and download from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gitux-co/downloads/releases).

## Installation

### Linux

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
Via terminal run the below, or double click the .deb file and click install:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i <path-to-downloaded-file>/Gitux.deb
```

**Flatpak:**
```bash
flatpak install <path-to-downloaded-file>/Gitux.flatpak
```

### Windows
Run the `.exe` installer and follow the prompts.

### macOS
Open the `.dmg` and drag Gitux to your Applications folder.

macOS may show a security warning because Gitux is distributed independently. This is normal for apps outside the Mac App Store.

If macOS blocks the app from opening, run this in Terminal first:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Gitux.app
```
Then open Gitux as normal.
