# Branches & Merging

Learn how to work with branches and merge changes in Gitux.

## The Sidebar

The left sidebar shows your repository's branch structure:

- **Local** — Branches on your machine
- **Remote** — Branches on remote servers (origin, etc.)
- **Stashes** — Saved work-in-progress

## Viewing Branches

### Branch Tree
Branches are displayed in a tree structure. Folders group related branches:
```
Local
├── main
├── develop
└── feature/
    ├── login
    └── dashboard
```

### Current Branch
The current branch (HEAD) is highlighted with a special badge and accent color.

### Branch Counts
Each section shows the total number of branches.

## Switching Branches

### Double-Click to Checkout
Double-click any local branch to switch to it (checkout).

### Single-Click to Highlight
Single-click a branch to scroll the commit graph to that branch's latest commit without switching.

## Creating Branches

### From Context Menu
1. Right-click any branch
2. Select **Branch from...**
3. Enter the new branch name
4. Gitux creates and switches to the new branch

### Branch Naming Tips
- Use prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)

## Merging Branches

### Drag & Drop Merge
The fastest way to merge:

1. **Drag** the source branch (the one with changes)
2. **Drop** it onto the target branch (where you want the changes)
3. Gitux will:
   - Switch to the target branch if needed
   - Perform the merge
   - Show success or conflict notification

### Context Menu Merge
1. Right-click the branch you want to merge FROM
2. Select **Merge into...**
3. Choose the target branch
4. Confirm the merge

### Merge Results

| Result | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Success** | Changes merged, commit graph updates |
| **Fast-forward** | Branch pointer moves, no merge commit |
| **Conflicts** | Conflict resolution screen opens |

### Post-Merge Cleanup
When you merge a branch with a `/` in its name (e.g. `feature/login`, `fix/timeout`), Gitux recognises it as a feature/fix/hotfix branch and offers to delete it:
- **Delete Local & Remote** — Clean up both copies
- **Delete Local Only** — Keep the remote
- **Keep Branch** — Do nothing

### Resolving Conflicts
If a merge results in conflicts, Gitux opens a dedicated resolution screen:
1. See all conflicted files listed
2. Click a file to view the conflict — **ours** vs **theirs**
3. Resolve each hunk individually or choose a side for the whole file
4. Click **Apply & Resolve** to save
5. Complete or abort the merge when ready

## Deleting Branches

### Delete Local Branch
1. Right-click the branch
2. Select **Delete branch**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Optionally delete from remote too

::: warning Cannot Delete Current Branch
You cannot delete the branch you're currently on. Switch to another branch first.
:::

### Delete Remote Branch
1. Right-click a remote branch
2. Select **Delete remote branch**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Optionally delete the local tracking branch

## Pushing and Pulling

### Push to Remote
Press `Ctrl+P` or use the header button to push your current branch to the remote.

### Pull from Remote
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to pull changes from the remote into your current branch.

### Behind/Ahead Indicators
The status bar shows if your branch is behind or ahead of the remote.

## Working with Remotes

### Remote Branches
Remote branches appear under the **Remote** section in the sidebar, organized by remote name (usually `origin`).

### Tracking
When you checkout a remote branch, Gitux creates a local tracking branch automatically.

## Best Practices

### Keep main/master Clean
- Don't commit directly to main
- Use feature branches for new work
- Merge via pull requests when possible

### Merge Often
- Regularly merge main into your feature branch
- Smaller, frequent merges are easier than big ones

### Delete Merged Branches
- Clean up branches after merging
- Keeps the sidebar tidy

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+P` | Push to remote |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Pull from remote |
