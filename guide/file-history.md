The file history panel shows:
- **File path** at the top
- **List of commits** that modified this file
- **Commit details** for each entry

Each commit entry displays:
- Commit message
- Author
- Date
- Short hash

## Viewing Changes

Click any commit in the file history to see:
- What changed in that specific commit
- The diff for just that file
- Before/after comparison

## Use Cases

### Understanding Code Evolution
See how a function or component changed over time:
1. Open file history for the file
2. Scroll through commits
3. Click each to see incremental changes

### Finding When a Bug Was Introduced
1. Open file history for the buggy file
2. Look for suspicious changes
3. Identify the commit that introduced the issue

### Tracking Authorship
See who made changes to a file and when:
- Each commit shows the author
- Useful for code review and questions

### Recovering Old Code
If you need to see how code looked before:
1. Find the relevant commit in history
2. View the file at that point
3. Copy what you need

## Navigating History

### Scrolling
- Scroll through the commit list
- Older commits are at the bottom

### Clicking Commits
- Click to view that commit's changes
- The diff viewer shows the file's changes

### Closing
- Click the X button
- Press Escape

## Tips

### Start from the Right File
Make sure you're viewing history for the correct file path. Renamed files may have separate histories.

### Look at Commit Messages
Good commit messages help you understand why changes were made, not just what changed.

### Check Related Files
If a file's history doesn't explain everything, check related files that might have been changed together.

## Limitations

### Renamed Files
Git tracks renames, but the history view may not follow renames automatically. You might see history only from the rename forward.

### Deleted Files
You cannot open file history for deleted files from the UI. Use the command line:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- path/to/deleted/file
```

### Large Histories
Files with hundreds of commits may take a moment to load.
