# The Commit Graph

The commit graph is the heart of Gitux — a visual representation of your entire Git history.

## Understanding the Graph

The commit graph shows:
- **Commits** as rows with message, author, and timestamp
- **Branch lines** as colored paths connecting commits
- **Branch labels** showing where each branch points
- **HEAD indicator** showing your current position

```
Graph    Message              Author       Date
──●───   feat: add login     John Doe     2 hours ago
  │
──●───   fix: typo           Jane Smith   5 hours ago
  │
──●───   Initial commit      John Doe     Yesterday
```

## Reading the Graph

### Commit Rows

Each row represents a commit and displays:
- **Graph column** — Visual branch lines and commit dots
- **Message** — The commit message (first line)
- **Author** — Who made the commit
- **Date/Time** — When the commit was made

### Branch Colors

Different branches are shown in different colors:
- Lines connect commits on the same branch
- Merge commits show where branches join
- The current branch is highlighted

### Uncommitted Changes

If you have uncommitted changes, they appear at the top of the graph as a special row showing:
- Number of staged files
- Number of unstaged files

## Interacting with Commits

### Click a Commit
Single-click a commit to:
- View the list of changed files
- See the diff for any file
- View commit details (full message, hash, etc.)

### Scroll to Load More
The graph loads commits incrementally for performance. Scroll down to load older commits automatically.

### Highlight from Sidebar
Click a branch in the sidebar to scroll the graph to that branch's latest commit.

## Commit Details Panel

When you click a commit, the details panel shows:

![Commit Details View](/screenshots/Screenshot%20-%20rich%20commit%20graph.png)

1. **File List** — All files changed in that commit
   - Toggle between list view and folder view
   - See additions (+) and deletions (-) per file
   
2. **Diff Viewer** — Click a file to see its changes
   - Unified or split view
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Minimap for navigation

### File Status Indicators

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **M** | Modified |
| **A** | Added |
| **D** | Deleted |
| **R** | Renamed |
| **C** | Copied |

## Context Menu Actions

Right-click on a commit to access:
- Reset branch to this commit
- Copy commit hash
- View commit in detail

Right-click on a file in the commit details to:
- View file history

## Search & Filter

Press `Ctrl+F` to open the search & filter bar above the graph. You can:

- **Search** commit messages and hashes by typing
- **Filter by author** using the dropdown
- **Set a date range** to narrow results
- **Search files** by name and open their history directly
- **Browse the file tree** to explore the repo and view any file's history

See [Search & Filter](/features/search-filter) for full details.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+F` | Toggle search & filter panel |
| `Escape` | Close commit details panel |
| `Ctrl+R` | Refresh the graph |

## Performance Tips

For large repositories:
- Gitux loads ~100 commits initially
- Scroll down to load more (infinite scroll)
- The graph remains responsive even with thousands of commits

## Visual Elements

### Branch Lines
- Straight lines = linear history
- Curved lines = branch divergence/merge
- Multiple colors = multiple active branches

### Merge Commits
Merge commits show two parent lines converging, making it easy to see where branches were integrated.

### Tags
Tags appear as labels on their associated commits.
